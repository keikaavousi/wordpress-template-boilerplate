## Documentation

It's just a boilerplate for your WordPress template(theme) development. Every time you want to create a wp project, you need to create the necessary template files. With this repo, you don't need to create them manually anymore!
<br>

You need to do three essential things:

1. Add all these files into the `wp-content/[your desired template name]` directory.

2. Change style.css files with your data:

```css
/*
Theme Name: Your theme name 
Theme URI: https://yourthemewebsite.com
Author: Your name
Author URI: https://yourwebsite.com
Description: This theme was completely designed and develeoped for my website
Version: 1.0
Text Domain: mytheme
Tags: one-column, flexible-header, accessibility-ready, custom-colors, custom-menu, custom-logo, editor-style, featured-images, footer-widgets, rtl-language-support, sticky-post, threaded-comments, translation-ready
*/
```

3. Replace "screenshot.png" with the screenshot image of your theme.
